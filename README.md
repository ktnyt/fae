## Installation

### Quick Development Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ktnyt/fae.git
cd fae

# 2. Install mise (if not already installed)
# macOS: brew install mise
# Other: https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html

# 3. Set up complete development environment
mise install    # Installs Rust + cargo tools
mise run setup  # Builds project + runs tests

# 4. Start development workflow (optional)
mise run dev    # Starts file watching with auto-format + coverage
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Development installation with Rust
git clone https://github.com/ktnyt/fae.git
cd fae
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### 🎨 TUI Mode (Primary Interface)

Simply run `fae` without arguments to launch the beautiful TUI:

```bash
fae  # Launch interactive TUI
```

**TUI Features:**
- **Real-time search** - Results update as you type
- **Multi-modal switching** - Tab/Shift+Tab to cycle between search modes
- **Visual progress** - See symbol indexing progress with file counts
- **Keyboard navigation** - Arrow keys, Enter to copy, Esc to quit
- **Smart cursor** - Background-highlighted cursor that doesn't disrupt layout
- **Adaptive UI** - Auto-sizing toasts and responsive layout

**Key Bindings:**
- `Tab` - Cycle search modes forward (Literal → Symbol → Variable → File → Regex)
- `Shift+Tab` - Cycle search modes backward (Literal ← Symbol ← Variable ← File ← Regex)
- `Enter` - Copy selected result to clipboard
- `Ctrl+C` / `Esc` - Exit
- `Ctrl+S` - Toggle statistics overlay
- `Ctrl+G` - Abort current search

### 💻 CLI Mode (Pipeline & Automation)

For scripting and pipeline integration:

```bash
# Direct search queries
fae "search_query"           # Content search (default)
fae "#function_name"         # Symbol search 
fae "$variable_name"         # Variable search
fae "@file_name"             # File search
fae "/regex_pattern"         # Regex search

# Pipeline support
fae "search" | head -10      # Limit results
fae "error" | grep -v test   # Filter results
```

### 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Development setup (with mise)
mise run setup      # Complete environment setup
mise run dev        # Start file watching workflow
mise run test       # Run tests with coverage
mise run clean      # Clean build artifacts

# Or use make directly
make help           # Show all available commands
make test-coverage  # Generate coverage report
make dev            # Format, lint, test, coverage

# Environment variables
RUST_LOG=debug fae  # Debug logging (especially useful for TUI mode)
```

### Library API (Rust)

```rust
use fae::{SearchCoordinator, IndexManager};

// Index building and symbol search
let mut coordinator = SearchCoordinator::new(project_root)?;
let result = coordinator.build_index()?;
let hits = coordinator.search_symbols("handleClick", 10);
```

### ⚡ Performance Characteristics (Measured)

- **Symbol Indexing**: ~70,000 symbols/second with advanced caching (50% improvement)
- **Cache Performance**: 281x speedup for identical file content, 2.1x for language configs
- **Content Search**: <100ms (ripgrep/ag backends with graceful fallback)
- **TUI Responsiveness**: 16ms polling for real-time search updates
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming processing for large codebases
- **Backend Strategy**: ripgrep → ag → native (automatic detection and fallback)

### Search Examples

```bash
# Symbol search: symbols containing "handle"
#handle

# File search: files containing "component"
>component

# Regex search: import statements
/^import.*from

# Content search: "error" in file contents
error
```
